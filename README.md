# Hackers-Keyboard
Modified apks of hackers keyboard and 3 langpacks to work with android 14
- Tested on samsung SM-A536B (A53 5G) running Android 14  on One ui 6.1
## What is Here?
1. A minimally modded Hackers-Keyboard apk
   - Modified _just_ enough to install on android 14
   - Contains some bugs such as the suggested text area not working and settings button crashing the app
   - I personally highly recommend using SeventhM's [forked version](https://github.com/SeventhM/hackerskeyboard)
2. A modified version of the German Autocoplete Dictionary
   - Modified to install succesfully on android 14
   - **IS NOT SEEN BY THE KEYBOARD**
4. A modified version of the English Autocoplete Dictionary
   - Modified to install succesfully on android 14
5. A custom made Romanian Autocomplete dictionary
   - Because I couldn't find any official versions
   - Dictionary ripped from AnySoftKeyboards Romanian dictionary
   - I've used the EN autocomplete dict as base
